var homePageHTML = "<h3>Data Visualization</h3><p>This Data Vizualization helps the audience to gain interesting insights into the history of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Billboard weekly top-100</span> charts. Peculiar patterns and trends in artists and theirs songs are depicted though charts. This visualization was built around the principle of an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Interactive Slideshow</span> based Prof. Hart's sessions.</p><p>The slideshow begins with this introuduction scene explaining about the visualizations itself and its adherence to the concepts covered in this course. Each scene can be selected through intuitive buttons placed in a navigation pane on the left-side of the web-page. Each scene is independent of the other and gives a different perspective of the data. Each scene consists of the chart itself and a short explanation that corroborates it.</p><h4>Scenes</h4><ul><li>Scene 1 - About the Visualization</li><li>Scene 2 : Hit-Songs - The first chart, a treemap that sizes the songs that have been on the charts for the longest</li><li>Scene 3 : Legends - A packed circle-chart that shows the artists who have been on the charts for the longest</li><li>Scene 4 - Die Hards - Focuses on the biggest come-backs to the top-5</li></ul><p>The data was obtained from the following URL: <a href=\"https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017\">https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017</a></p><p>This dataset has chart-listings from 1958 until 2017. The data was first loaded onto a databased for mining and preparing for the visualization.</p>";

var hitSongsHTML = "<h3>Hit Songs</h3><p>The tree-map layout highlights the no. of weeks a particular song has been on the billboard top-100 list. The data shown in this representation corresponds to a top-most slice of data In essense, songs that have been on the charts for fewer than 55 weeks have not been included in this layout so as to focus on the super-hits.</p><h4>Deduction</h4><p>Evidently, the week-count of 87 is placed in the largest block. This is the song - Radio Active by Imagine Dragons and has been for the longest on the billboard charts.</p><h4>Chart Features</h4><ul><li>Choice of Layout : Treemaps are good at comparing quantitative values. To accentuate the change in quantitative values, saturation also has been used. Higher qantities have large area and hgher saturation.</li><li>Ablility to Explore : Out-right, the chart doesn't show name of the song or the artist. That would take up a lot of space and would not fit into the blocks. Users can hover over the chart and use tool-tips to further explore.</li><li>Effective usage of scene in narration : This visualization highlights songs that have been successful fro the longest&nbsp;</li><li>Usage of annotations : The chart has annotated with the number values of the number of weeks a song had been on the billboard. Besides, tooltips also let the user dynamically view annotations of each block on the treemap</li><li>Usage of Parameters : NA</li><li>Usage of Triggers : The&nbsp; slide-show itself is triggered by the user selecting a button. Each button calls a function to lay out the corresponding chart.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>";



var lengendsHTML = "<h3>Legends - Artists with the longest run-rate</h3><p>The packed-circle-chart layout highlights the no. of weeks artists have been on the billboard top-100 list. The data shown in this representation corresponds to the top-most slice of data viz. artists that have been on the charts for more than 418 weeks so as to focus on the most successful artists. An artist could have multiple songs and hence the number of weeks show in the chart spans across different songs and albums.</p><h4>Deduction</h4><p>Clearly, 812 weeks is right at the top and is by the pop-legend - Elton John.</p><h4>Chart Features</h4><ul><li>Choice of Layout : Similar to treemaps, packed circle charts are also good at comparing quantitative values. Beside the area of the circle, a differene hue has been selected to highlight larger values.</li><li>Ablility to Explore : Users can hover over the chart and use tool-tips to further explore.</li><li>Effective usage of scene in narration : This scene gives a different perspective of the successful artists in retaining a prolonged and successful run-rate in the music industry</li><li>Usage of annotations : The chart has annotated with the number values of the number of weeks an artist had been on the billboard. Besides, tooltips also let the user dynamically view annotations of each block on the packed-circle-chart</li><li>Usage of Parameters : The hovering event of the user is captured as a parameter in displaying the appropriate tooltip with the artist's name</li><li>Usage of Triggers : The&nbsp; slide-show itself is triggered by the user selecting a button.

The Y-axis shows the Gap in between consecutive top-5s.&nbsp;</p><h4>Deduction</h4><p>The music maestro - Prince and his is group performed in 2016 to have succesful hits giving them a taste of the top-5 after a prolonged period of nearly 30 years. It is easy to note that Prince was a one-off success story and the next closest is only about 17 years by Donno Osmond.
